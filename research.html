				There are currently 11 people in our group, 1 professor, 1 tenure track, 2 post docs

			<p>
				The research is very broad, ranging from entropy-driven systems, to patchy particles
				to non-equilibrium topics.			
				We collaborate closely with our colleagues from the experimental division. In fact,
				we have a joint weekly group meeting with them, but we also meet regularly with 
				the soft matter theory group from the <a href="http://testweb.science.uu.nl/ITF/"

				These collaborations drive part of our research. To bring insights into an 
				"in house" experiment from simulations is very valuable and not	rarely the other

				<h2 id="tetlav">Fabrication of Colloidal Laves Phases via Hard Tetramers and Hard Spheres:
				Bulk Phase Diagram and Sedimentation Behaviour</h2>
			</hgroup>
	
			<p>
			Colloidal photonic crystals display peculiar optical properties which make them particularly 
			suitable for application in different fields. However, the low packing fraction of the targeted 
			structures usually poses a real challenge in the fabrication stage. Here, we propose a route to 
			colloidal photonic crystals <i>via</i> a binary mixture of hard tetramers and hard spheres. 
			By combining theory and computer simulations, we calculate the phase diagram as well as the 
			stacking diagram of the mixture, and show that a colloidal analogue of the MgCu&#8322; 
			Laves phase &mdash; which can serve as a precursor of a photonic bandgap structure &mdash; is a 
			thermodynamically stable phase in a large region of the phase diagram. Our findings show a relatively 
			large coexistence region between the fluid and the Laves phase, which is potentially accessible 
			by experiments. Furthermore, we determine the sedimentation behaviour of the suggested mixture, 
			by identifying several stacking sequences in the sediment. Our work uncovers a self-assembly 
			path towards a photonic structure with a band gap in the visible region.

				<h2 id="mmgl">Fluid phase behaviour of "Mickey Mouse" particles</h2>
			</hgroup>
	
			<p>
			   Recent developments in the synthesis of colloidal particles allow for control over shape and 
			   inter-particle interaction. One example, among others, is the so-called ‘‘Mickey Mouse’’ (MM) particle 
			   for which the self-assembly properties have been previously studied yielding a stable cluster phase 
			   together with elongated, tube-like structures. Here, we investigate under which conditions a fluid 
			   of Mickey Mouse particles can yield phase separation and how the self-assembly behaviour affects the 
			   gas–liquid coexistence. We vary the distance between the repulsive and the attractive lobes (bond 
			   length), and the interaction range, and follow the evolution of the gas–liquid (GL) coexistence curve. 
			   We find that upon increasing the bond length distance the binodal line shifts to lower temperatures, 
			   and that the interaction range controls the transition between phase separation and self-assembly of 
			   clusters. Upon further reduction of the interaction range and temperature, the clusters assume an 
			   increasingly ordered tube-like shape, ultimately matching the one previously reported in literature. 
			   These results are of interest when designing particle shape and particle–particle interaction for 
			   self-assembly processes.

				<h2 id="mickey-mouse">"Mickey Mouse" in Vitro and in Silico</h2>
			</hgroup>
	
			<p>
			   The self-assembly of anisotropic patchy particles with a triangular shape was studied by experiments 
			   and computer simulations. The colloidal particles were synthesized in a two-step seeded emulsion
			   polymerization process, and consist of a central smooth lobe connected to two rough lobes at an angle
			   of ~90 degrees , resembling the shape of a "Mickey Mouse" head.  Due to the difference in overlap volume, adding an appropriate depletant induces an attractive interaction between the smooth lobes of the colloids only, while the two rough lobes act as steric constraints. The essentially planar geometry 
			   of the Mickey Mouse particles is a first geometric deviation of dumbbell shaped patchy particles. 
			   This new geometry enables the formation of one-dimensional tube-like structures rather than spherical,
			   essentially zero-dimensional micelles. At sufficiently strong attractions, we indeed find tube-like
			   structures with the sticky lobes at the core and the non-sticky lobes pointing out as steric constraints
			   that limit the growth to one direction, providing the tubes with a well-defined diameter but variable
			   length both in experiments and simulations. In the simulations, we found that the internal structure of
			   the tubular fragments could either be straight or twisted into so-called Bernal spirals.

			</hgroup>
	
			<p>
			   We employ Monte Carlo simulations to investigate the self-assembly of patchy colloidal dumbbells
			   interacting via a modified Kern-Frenkel potential by probing the system concentration and dumbbell
			   shape. We consider dumbbells consisting of one attractive sphere with diameter σ1 and one 
			   repulsive sphere with diameter σ2 and center-to-center distance d between the spheres. For three 
			   different size ratios, we study the self-assembled structures for different separations 
			   l = 2d/(σ1 + σ2) between the two spheres. In particular, we focus on structures that can be 
			   assembled from the homogeneous fluid, as these might be of interest in experiments. We use 
			   cluster order parameters to classify the shape of the formed structures. When the size of the spheres 
			   is almost equal, q = σ2/σ1 = 1.035, we find that, upon increasing l, spherical micelles are 
			   transformed to elongated micelles and finally to vesicles and bilayers. For size ratio q = 1.25, 
			   we observe a continuously tunable transition from spherical to elongated micelles upon increasing 
			   the sphere separation. For size ratio q = 0.95, we find bilayers and vesicles, plus faceted polyhedra 
			   and liquid droplets. Our results identify key parameters to create colloidal vesicles with attractive 
			   dumbbells in experiments.
